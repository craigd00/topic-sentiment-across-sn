* How people use social networks to connect with each other, but there is a lot of misinformation existing on these platforms
* Are social networks influencing peoples opinions
* Software should be able to look at what is happening using, using APIs 
* Technical deliverable interface with APIs
* Gave example of firehose as API for twitter
* Should have specific classifier, NLP parsing to gauge user sentiment
* Can use Python if preferred language - up to me, and established libraries
* Classifier used to understand general sentiment, quantify this sentiment and determine differences between platforms

### On finished project
* Project will be a success if can take two SN platforms with APIs and see if there is differences
* Users will not be using it, UI is not important with this
* Evaluation should prove there is an accurate classifier, investigative development
