# Met the following week but had updated supervisor on teams on progress as MSc project readings were still going on

### What I had done since last meeting
* Figured out the top subreddits and have some graphics on each of them
* Got top 10 subreddits from each query based on number of posts
* Plotted negative positive neutral as well as comparing the topics overall with these

### For the next meeting
* Changing from number of posts to percentage of posts, easier to compare fairly
* Plan to run code again multiple times to see if sentiment changes at different times
