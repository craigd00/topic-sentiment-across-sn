### What I had done since last meeting
* Looked over the research papers and made notes on papers, what could be useful
* Set up Github + wiki
* Set up Overleaf
* Did not get chance to do more this week as I was ill

### Sentiment Analysis
* Look at and develop NLP classifier to gauge sentiment
* Can use text files with fake responses to see emotion before testing
* See how different researchers try to gauge it
* Python libraries: word2vec
* Take text input, figure out how to scale it
* Look at statistical deviation between platforms
* Challenge when seeing no longer positive or negative
* Naive approach for the time being
* Time permitting, see if can fine tune

### Questions
* Should scale be very positive -> very negative, positive -> negative, neutral included?
* Answer: 3 point scale - Positive, Neutral, Negative

### For the next meeting
* Add supervisor to Github and Overleaf to see development
* Look at Python libraries for emotion and sentiment analysis, see if it will output data needed
