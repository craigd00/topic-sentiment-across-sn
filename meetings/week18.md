### What I had done since last meeting
* Been trying to get BERT working
* Training model felt like it would take too long
* Using a model from hugging face transformer library for social media sentiment, takes a while to run but it works, so trying to optimise it
* Started to think about plan for my diss, aiming to start to write on Monday or before 

### BERT
* Interesting to see how long it takes to run
* If NLP libraries are taking different times, performance impact on scalability
* VADER sacrifices accuracy for speed

### Writeup?
* Hoping to start Monday, had lots of coursework due
* No issues at looking at unfinished work, send anything
* Gave explanation on different topics in dissertation

### Intro
* Set scene, talk about topic, relevance, questions we want to ask ourselves
* What is it about lexical analysis and NLP that has been done, how it relates?
* Discussion of methods to understand sentiment
* Overview of different NLP, key players, Python libraries
* Person reading will understand topics, give passing refresher, what makes these techniques applicable for this topic
* Brief intro, rationale for selecting them

### Design
* Methods an theories, how do we want to analyse this?
* How does architecture relate?
* Diagram relating to method

### Requirements
* Taught in SE, must have, could haves
* Start at beginning, MOSCOW, wireframes, user stories

### Evaluation
* 2 parts - Software/Technology, Research (Our contribution of work)
* Unit testing to validate behaviour of what we have used to ensure code works
* Rationale for conducting those tests
* VADER v Others, how accurate, good and scalable(important) to address our problem, comparing VADER to other NLPs

### Discussion
* Evaluation involves conducting experiments to articulate - step back from experiment to talk about results
* Explanations for anomolies
* Discuss graphs
* Good way to finish discussion is to talk about limitations of work put together (threats and validity, how to improve)
* Open and honest, identifying those is difference with good and bad diss
* Future work - always going to be more that can be done, tak ework forward to improve

### Conclusion
* Usual conclusion, sum up etc

### For the next meeting
* Keep going with BERT, try and make quicker or just keep running
* Attempt to begin dissertation
