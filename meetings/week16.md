### What I had done since last meeting
* Modularised my code to produce graphics and run the notebooks
* Displayed graphs for all three runs of reddit and twitter terms
* Displayed graphs on TextBlob v Vader terms
* Started to collect papers to read through

### Evaluation for dissertation
* We have a 2 tier model, Reddit v Twitter, as well as investigating subcommunities
* Comparison between evaluation
* Good way to structure evaluation, common goal with multiple methods getting there
* Main goal of project is to understand user sentiment
* Good way for evaluation is to compare Reddit/Twitter and the communities within, as well as comparing NLP libraries

### NLP libraries
* Look at as many NLP modules as possible 
* 6 - 12 different libraries would be a good range
* More NLP = better evaluation
* Have classifier as stretch goal, do libraries for now


### For the next meeting
* Find more NLP libraries to analyse sentiment
* Get top 10 negative and positive subreddits
* If time have a look at classifiers
* Remove unwanted posts from reddit
