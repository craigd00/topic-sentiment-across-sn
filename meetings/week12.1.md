### What I had done since last meeting
* Ran the code on queries
* Have graphics on Twitter and Reddit, as well as information on subreddits
* Still to do: Filter out reddit words, get top 10 negative and positive subreddits

### Sentiment changing
* Idea on looking at how sentiment changes over weeks/months is interesting idea
* Helps identify disinformation
* Over time can see sentiment evolving, sentiment tied to specific tags
* boosters = vaccine, omicron = covid
* Correlate change to event occurring

### For the next meeting
* So far solid plan to gauge what we have
* Potential for a classifier
* Run per week for a month to see how data evolves
* Constrain scope - identify anything of noteworthiness
