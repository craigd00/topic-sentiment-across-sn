@ScotRail are thieves. They tell you if you buy a fully flexible ticket you can get your money back. They then strike for months . Take weeks to look at your request and charge you £10 admin fee. To add insult to injury the customer service phone staff are useless: RESULT = NEGATIVE

@Bonniel83154575 @AndyClark22 @ScotRail Not directly cos poor wee Archie is going to lose his job any way so the trick then is to say if this happens whats the rewards for the rest.

@JimfromOldham Savvy travellers take @LumoTravel via Edinburgh using a separate @ScotRail ticket. However Lumo is so popular it's booked for weeks ahead. Had you booked earlier Jim you could have taken the train and paid much less than £135.: RESULT = POSITIVE
@LNER @ScotRail A different bus when this one was taking hours. People in the group had been travelling 12+ hours - the service we received was shocking.

@thebufferstop @AndyClark22 @ScotRail I get that but at the end of the day proper discussion should happen it shouldn’t be slipped in as a terms and condition for a pay!

@ScotRail I'm sorry but I've just been to France, not just the trains, the metro and bus services, guess what their transport system is a million times better than that of Scotland.

@OnlyJohn9 @KeepLeftOfLeft @lisaandbilly @ScotRail 2/ When I agree workers are being shafted, I'll support them. I just won't give a blank cheque, that's all. That already makes me a monster according to some...

@OnlyJohn9 @KeepLeftOfLeft @lisaandbilly @ScotRail 1/ Agreed 100%. I have regularly publicly supported / strikes, both when living in England &amp; now in Scotland.

@AvantiWestCoast @MichaelH887 Hi all, we don't run to London Euston, so it is likely that this journey is Stirling to Edinburgh with ScotRail, and then Edinburgh to Euston with yourselves, Avanti, OR it's Stirling to King's Cross.

No need to go looking to blame a country as that would absolve any personal responsibilities of the people who work at scotrail who have a responsibility to the customer: RESULT = POSITIVE
@ScotRail @NetworkRailGQS I've not used the station since the racks were in the car park off North hanover st.  Where are the racks?: RESULT = NEUTRAL
@OnlyJohn9 @NelsonCombe @PatrickJC1994 @ScotRail Well I think as they are mainly on the longer routes they are trained in what to do should the driver become incapacitated. All staff are trained in what to do in the event of a crash though, like securing the line (If able). So you would maybe need to ask a conductor.: RESULT = POSITIVE

@KeepLeftOfLeft @OnlyJohn9 @lisaandbilly @ScotRail The selfish people are the ones going one strike and the RMT. I support probably 90% of strikes, but not this one. That doesn't immediately make me a scab. It's ok to be critical and this one isn't justified.: RESULT = NEGATIVE

@OnlyJohn9 @NelsonCombe @PatrickJC1994 @ScotRail Yes they are, they are classed as safety critical, have route knowledge and a higher degree of training.

@lindsay3180 @ScotRail Theres never been a single days strike on a Sunday bit an agreement not to work overtime and as Sundays are all overtime shifts then there's no or very little staff available to work.

@ScotRail But the question is, will this stop the strikes?: RESULT = NEGATIVE
@NetworkRailSCOT The railways in the UK and Scotland in particular have become too unreliable, too expensive and too much hassle.

@seanraaron @ValerieRooney1 @wgsaraband It's not just about pay, but also conditions.. Scotrail also want the union to give up in all other disputes..

@ScotRail @carolynnscrim Does your contingency involve giving them what they want and deserve? Like you should have done months ago...: RESULT = POSITIVE
@ScotRail quick question...with regards to the strike happening next week do you know if LNER trains will still run to Aberdeen....or is it just Scotrail trains affected....: RESULT = NEGATIVE
We’re letting fresh air in – many of our trains have air handling systems to keep air on board clean and fresh.

Those without have lots of unlocked opening windows. https://t.co/5H45PNVZsZ: RESULT = POSITIVE
@hendo_nagasaki Hey, is it a refund for an unused ticket or a delayed journey? ^Angus: RESULT = NEGATIVE
@Citycollege_SJ Nothing yet, Sarah-Jayne. ^Angus: RESULT = NEUTRAL
@oxsafe Hello there. We are expecting our guest to arrive around 10:30 am as our guests have had to get ticket acceptance on a Scotrail service. Apologies for the delay. Garry.: RESULT = POSITIVE
@PPaulcl64 @Jlb11210 @greenjedi8 @ScotRail This is a temporary extra payment for drivers I think, it was linked to training being stopped during covid (no two persons in a cab) and was extended due to the driver shortage. The rest of the railway staff didn't get this  payment extended hence the current dispute.: RESULT = NEGATIVE
@brysondavid14 No plans at the moment, David. Demand hasn't recovered for that frequency yet, all services running with eight carriages (542 seats). ^Angus: RESULT = NEGATIVE
@carolynnscrim Hi Carolynn, there's still work going on to try and avoid a strike if at all possible. We're working on contingency plans should these fail. ^Angus: RESULT = NEGATIVE
@ScotRail 7:48 Cowdenbeath to Edinburgh today and 17:08 last night from Edinburgh to Glenrothes via Dunfermline: RESULT = NEUTRAL
@mangowhizz @istreasatuatha @ScotRail It’s worse for RMT grades and much worse for Conductors particularly. It could potentially completely alter the role of Conductors. Who would knock back a 4.7% rise in todays climate? It’s all about the conditions attached.: RESULT = NEGATIVE
@sommie999 Hi Alastair, which departure from Cowdenbeath is this? ^Angus: RESULT = NEUTRAL
@irishpedro Sorry for this, I'll flag that up now. ^Angus: RESULT = NEGATIVE
Services to/from Lanark are still unable to run for now.

@JamesMcCreadie3 @istreasatuatha @ScotRail In what way?: RESULT = NEUTRAL
@ScotRail Thanks for the reply. Can you let us know when those plans are due to be finalised please? Is @scotgov getting incolved? This strike + the Glasgow Road closures renders it pretty much impossible for some of us who don't drive to get to work during that 2 weeks.. @NicolaSturgeon: RESULT = POSITIVE

@TaysideTweets @ScotRail @RMTunion @NicolaSturgeon Whoever is behind this idea is the issue. They are putting their needs for a bigger pay, above the entire world's problems. Unbelievably selfish &amp; ridiculous. Do it AFTER #COP26 FFS.: RESULT = NEGATIVE
@ScotRail where do I find a UTN for a Trainline ticket to claim a refund for a cancelled train?: RESULT = NEGATIVE
@ScotRail so no trains because of strikes? I can't wait for self driving trains so you all can stop hold people at ransom.: RESULT = NEGATIVE
As if @ScotTories moanfest were not dirge enoug, they have sealed a pact with the union devil to find fault with @scotgov

Morning @ScotRail - how come you’re still making tannoy announcements about Sunday strike action but not about the planned strike during #COP26 next week? 

I rely on trains to get to work in the hospital, and I don’t know how to plan my clinics just now. Will it be resolved?: RESULT = POSITIVE
@ScotRail why are the trains from Cowdenbeath to/from Edinburgh reduced prior to lockdown 6 carriages, during Covid to 3 (due to numbers travelling) and now down to 2 when they are getting busier?: RESULT = NEUTRAL
@nuttyneil999 That train is still on time, Neil. ^Angus: RESULT = NEUTRAL
🚦 The temporary repair has been completed and trains can now run in both directions on the West Coast Mainline.

Our team have now turned their attention to getting the Lanark line back up and running. Thanks for your patience. 

@AvantiWestCoast @CalSleeper @TPEassist @ScotRail: RESULT = POSITIVE

@ScotRail how do you identify from the outside what carriage has space for a bike? Is there a sign on the outside of the carraige: RESULT = NEUTRAL
scotrail ticket prices are also criminal and i can’t believe i have to pay that much for their trains to be cancelled half the time x: RESULT = NEGATIVE
@ScotRail I must go to work that's a requirement but can't do that when there's no trains.: RESULT = NEGATIVE

@mdoherty1988 Really sorry for this, there's a signalling issue down at the junction for Lanark that's stopping trains getting through. You can use your ticket on the number 41 bus to Motherwell in the meantime. ^Angus: RESULT = NEGATIVE
🛠️ We've now got staff at Lanark Junction. They're going to make a temporary fix that will allow trains on the West Coast Mainline to run.

However, it will prevent trains running to/from Lanark until a complete repair is done. 

@AvantiWestCoast @CalSleeper @TPEassist @ScotRail: RESULT = POSITIVE
@TaysideTweets @ScotRail @RMTunion @NicolaSturgeon Scotrail and the Government shouldn't compromise. These are bullying tactics by the RMT. Cynical use of COP26 to force the issue in their favour. A rail strike during COP26 would be a national embarrassment.: RESULT = NEGATIVE
@ScotRail and your still prepared to cause even more major disruption to the public during #COP26Glasgow when I might not even get into work at all, resulting in no pay at all! Pathetic company https://t.co/nr4mZKnhhR: RESULT = NEGATIVE
@ScotRail Has the actual strike been confirmed? The scotrail site continues to state 'should the strikes go ahead...' Confirmation of the strike from Scotrail would be helpful.: RESULT = NEGATIVE

@ScotRail already causing enough disruption to the public on Sundays with #strikeaction and most early morning west coast trains continually late into Central!! Quick enough to take our money though, whilst running a way below par service! https://t.co/nr4mZKnhhR: RESULT = NEGATIVE
@STARBRIGHT164 @TommySheppard @scottishfirst The proposed rail strikes are an embarrassment to our country. Bully union leaders taking an opportunity to hold Scotrail and the whole country over a barrel. Shocking tactics.: RESULT = NEGATIVE
@Soulcage62 The 0638 is the delayed 0615 from Ayr, Alan. Looks like the 0644 has picked up a few mins delay on its way down from Ardrossan. ^Angus: RESULT = NEGATIVE

This still applies if you're seated, more than 1m away from others, or are fully vaccinated. Exemptions apply. https://t.co/mDcowtFMPV: RESULT = POSITIVE
@ScotRail will there be a replacement bus service being offered during the strike action taking place during cop26?: RESULT = NEGATIVE
@Soulcage62 Hi Alan, they're mostly okay - the 0615 left late due to a crewing issue and the 0650 was cancelled due to a shortage of crew. All others should be grand. ^Angus: RESULT = POSITIVE
@sleeper_fan @LNER @ScotRail @CrossCountryUK Not from where I’d be getting the train from sadly 😂: RESULT = NEUTRAL
👷 We're dealing with a signalling fault at Lanark Junction that's stopping us running trains northbound on the West Coast Mainline, nor on the branch line to or from Lanark.

@mleah26 @redned76 @psalts1 @RMTunion @ScotRail There is a big difference not working your rest day which is money over your basic pay and actually striking on days that affect basic pay. 

anyways at the stage I hope the strike happens and the strikers lose 10 days of pay. I’ll just hunker down and get the bus to work: RESULT = NEGATIVE

@GraemeDeyMSP just wondering how you plan on implementing a pay rise to some ScotRail staff but not all? I’m sure that’s discrimination, as well as illegal under the Equal Pay Act. Also why haven’t you included the changes to staff’s conditions and job roles in your statement?: RESULT = NEGATIVE
@ScotRail @LarkinPacey Thank you again, especially for feeding this back. He mostly travels from Motherwell or Hamilton to Glasgow. Generally your staff are fabulous when he asks for help or direction. I just want to know that he and his friends/companions can rely safely on the rules when they travel.: RESULT = POSITIVE

@ScotRail @LarkinPacey Thanks for your reply, it's appreciated but this happens all the time. The blind companion is not the same as a carer but staff do not seem to know what the plus 1 means.

at the risk of being called a scab, the scotrail all-out strike is obscenely irresponsible. not only do commuters rely on trains to get to work, but they’re a safe and cheap form of transportation – cancelling all trains is a massive fuck you to women in particular, especially rn: RESULT = NEGATIVE

@ScotRail I read that bit, but how can you submit a ticket that has already been taken by the barrier (3 hours late). It was a single.

@ScotRail Im heading to perth, the issue i take Dean is that it is continuously cancelled, on the day,on monday mornings, it makes it very difficult for me as i have to then walk or take a bus at my expense to carnoustie to get the later service which gets me very late for work.: RESULT = NEGATIVE

With World leader due to arrive this week I would think it's better fixing things that putting on a show of Eastenders for them: RESULT = NEGATIVE
@RMTunion Don't you think that's for @scotgov to deal with instead of the "industrial action" to refuse the pay deal from @ScotRail for its workers is also an absolute shambles. It is just greed. Mean while you have other general workers and those who work in EMS that rely on trains.: RESULT = NEGATIVE
Well back to normal after my trip to #London @LNER  was a fantastic train journey especially the 1st class trip down which simply pissed all over the #Sleeper trip a few months back. A fine train back 2 until @ScotRail binned our train and we all crammed into the @CrossCountryUK: RESULT = POSITIVE

@thejoedoe1 Without doubt. With rising cases in the uk, a leaked document of potential another lockdown at Xmas yet this still gets the go ahead is baffling to say the least !  What’s up with all having a zoom call together ?? Now scotrail are on strike going to be chaos 🤦‍♂️🙄🙄: RESULT = NEGATIVE

@therusselwhite @JW1888_ @scotrailsucks @ScotRail Given the amount of shit rail workers have to put up with, I totally understand why they're on strike over this.: RESULT = NEGATIVE
For the gammon in the back, the point of a strike is to show how valuable &amp; necessary a service is to the public.

Without it we have inconveniences &amp; many left without transport in this case.

@the_cam_walker @MahriReilly @ScotRail @Abellio_UK You haven’t upset me and I don’t mind the push back. We stayed on topic and didn’t get personal so it’s a healthy argument/ debate 👍🏻: RESULT = NEGATIVE
@the_cam_walker @MahriReilly @ScotRail @Abellio_UK 5/ the unions should have been looking towards next March as long as management did not change current terms and conditions or impose compulsory redundancies between Apr 21 and Feb 22: RESULT = NEGATIVE
@the_cam_walker @MahriReilly @ScotRail @Abellio_UK 4/ the union was picking a fight with a Management team that’s out the door so why would they be invested in the future of scotrail and talking to the union.: RESULT = NEGATIVE
@the_cam_walker @MahriReilly @ScotRail @Abellio_UK 3/ this current strike action was born out of a temporary enhance payment that RMT lost but ASLEF drivers kept till Oct due to badly negotiated deal. It was a small issue that should not have become a strike issue considering what is looming down the road: RESULT = NEGATIVE
@the_cam_walker @MahriReilly @ScotRail @Abellio_UK 2/ With that back drop all the unions should be working on a viable plan for scotrail going forward to be presented to the Gov and Scot’s people in Feb 22. Let the negotiations commence and if need be the threat of strike action if agreement can’t be sought: RESULT = NEGATIVE
@the_cam_walker @MahriReilly @ScotRail @Abellio_UK 1/ The franchise is changing to public hands come March 22. Scotrail has been funded by the tax payer since Apr 20 to Dec 21 because customer numbers have plummeted: RESULT = NEUTRAL

@OnlyJohn9 @MahriReilly @ScotRail @Abellio_UK Also, I apologise if I've upset you. I didn't mean to and also didn't mean to use scab in (too) of a derogatory way - I was being lighthearted in my use of it (despite meaning it in the sense of anti-strike or picket crossing).: RESULT = POSITIVE
@OnlyJohn9 @MahriReilly @ScotRail @Abellio_UK So why don't you agree with the strike then? Lack of transport options because that is the direct point of a strike.: RESULT = NEGATIVE
@the_cam_walker @MahriReilly @ScotRail @Abellio_UK Did I say who was in the wrong during the miners strike?.. nope 

I’m not surprised you haven’t engaged on anything other than scab because it was evident from your first tweet that scab is your go to answer to anyone who doesn’t agree with strike: RESULT = POSITIVE
@ThePinkMongoose @ScotRail Yep that’s exactly what happened…trainline didn’t even notify us the train was cancelled.  So we just discovered when we got to the station. Poor show: RESULT = NEGATIVE
@OnlyJohn9 @MahriReilly @ScotRail @Abellio_UK Because, of course, if we've learnt anything from the miners strikes, it was that the strikers that were in the wrong. 

I haven't seen any points really to engage with - just the fact you didn't like my use of the word "scab" on which I just disagree with you.: RESULT = NEGATIVE
@the_cam_walker @MahriReilly @ScotRail @Abellio_UK Well it seems you keep bringing it back up and using it at every moment you can as if that’s the magical counter argument to anyone who doesn’t agree with the strike. 

You can’t even use it in its correct so called definition: RESULT = POSITIVE
@Edinburgh78 @ScotRail @RMTunion hitting weekends to affect people on their off time as well, and vulnerable groups who can't drive. Maybe weekday strikes would be a danger of leading to success, with them having to go back to work again.: RESULT = NEGATIVE
The Scottish government has accused the RMT union of "letting its members down" by rejecting a pay deal for ScotRail staff. 2 Unions have agreed 1 has put it to its members BUT the RMT Union want a political strike against the Scottish Government and Labour supports them: RESULT = POSITIVE
@aky13 @ScotRail @RMTunion I've been working on assumption that Scotrail isn't remotely interested and happy to avoid running trains on less profitable days. Time their franchise was pulled.: RESULT = POSITIVE
@AndroutsouElena @ScotRail As of late in the week they hadn't pulled the services from the databases meaning other companies such as LNER were selling tickets for cancelled trains! Pathetically hopeless.: RESULT = NEGATIVE
@ScotRail @MNDScotland That's a great effort 👍: RESULT = POSITIVE
@ScotRail @LoobyLo85887594 How come Stirling is being completely cut off by these strikes? You're mucking around the trains in random villages in the central belt on emergency timetables but Stirling - nah.: RESULT = NEGATIVE

@the_cam_walker @MahriReilly @ScotRail @Abellio_UK 2/ I’m sure with your university education you can at least afford some decency to engage with the individual on the points they made instead of calling them a scab (which doesn’t even apply to them): RESULT = POSITIVE
@politeconverse Hi there, trains with sealed windows have HVAC (Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning) systems installed, the system wouldn't work properly if the windows opened. The system doesn't only recirculate air, it replaces it with fresh air too. ^Megan

@the_cam_walker @MahriReilly @ScotRail @Abellio_UK 1/ I was around during the miners strike and I seen the word scab used in offensive context and intimidation. It’s not just a happy go lucky word but a way to dehumanise another person.: RESULT = NEGATIVE
@ScotRail I love travelling by train but until you install some air filtration Hepa 13 or have windows that open I will avoid for now sadly.: RESULT = NEGATIVE
@ScotRail Year round savings?? You're about to run no service at all for over a fortnight!

@NicolaSturgeon when are you going to remove the franchise from these clowns?: RESULT = NEGATIVE
@OnlyJohn9 @MahriReilly @ScotRail @Abellio_UK What an enormous and embarrassing overreaction to the word "scab". I'll come back to this thread when authoritarianism is ushered in by people not being quite as polite as you'd like.: RESULT = NEGATIVE
@the_cam_walker @MahriReilly @ScotRail @Abellio_UK I will when you clearly show intolerance to others making free choices and your only defence is to call them a name that doesn’t even apply to them: RESULT = POSITIVE
@the_cam_walker @MahriReilly @ScotRail @Abellio_UK But yet I don’t work for scotrail and you call me a scab for simply not agreeing with the strike. You clearly show intolerance for others who don’t agree with you 

Again you’re pressed on people who don’t agree with the strike so don’t try and elevate yourself 😂: RESULT = POSITIVE
@the_cam_walker @MahriReilly @ScotRail @Abellio_UK 3/ What I don’t respect and will fight against with others and even with myself is the dehumanising of the individual as to invalidate their freedom to express their beliefs and choices: RESULT = POSITIVE

@the_cam_walker @MahriReilly @ScotRail @Abellio_UK 2/ I respect those individuals who wish to form a union in a workplace and the right to strike. But unfortunately I don’t agree with this particular strike action: RESULT = POSITIVE
@the_cam_walker @MahriReilly @ScotRail @Abellio_UK 1/ Respect means a lot of things. 

For me i respect the rights of others to choose in a open society what they wish to do and believe in as long as it does not cross those legal boundaries that society has set.: RESULT = POSITIVE
@ScotRail Heavy rain? One drop of water and the scotrail service is in trouble. Yes please check before you leave as they often cancel trains for no reason and blame it on a supernatural event: RESULT = NEGATIVE

@OnlyJohn9 @MahriReilly @ScotRail @Abellio_UK Trade unionists have been using that word for as long as unions have been around. It isn’t a slur, or even particularly offensive, it just means someone anti-strike. I legit don’t see the problem. You can be as much of a scab as you please, but don’t lecture me about “democracy”: RESULT = NEGATIVE
@_rachelsteph @ScotRail You've answered your own question, plan as if they are going to be on strike...then you have a plan and if the trains run you get the train.: RESULT = NEUTRAL
@OnlyJohn9 @MahriReilly @ScotRail @Abellio_UK At the end of the day, I believe you can be as anti-strike or even anti-union as you like (not that I think you are). But does that mean I have to respect your position? Absolutely not - why would it?: RESULT = POSITIVE
@OnlyJohn9 @MahriReilly @ScotRail @Abellio_UK I exclusively use public transport, especially the train, so will be affected by this. but I support the rights of workers to decide on the conditions of their employment and to fight exploitation. It’s literally just a word dude.: RESULT = NEGATIVE

@the_cam_walker @MahriReilly @ScotRail @Abellio_UK 4/ this is not about a democratic decision for strike action but your intolerance to others for simply not following what you believe. You severely lack democratic principles and are more like a wee tin pot dictator: RESULT = NEGATIVE
@the_cam_walker @MahriReilly @ScotRail @Abellio_UK 3/ yet at no time did I say I was in the union or work for scotrail but yet you called me a scab for simply not agreeing with the strike action. I’m just an individual citizen who uses the trains and does not agree with the strike: RESULT = NEGATIVE
@the_cam_walker @MahriReilly @ScotRail @Abellio_UK 2/ what’s really startling  is you trying to push this democratic majority vote for strike action and the validity of calling people a scab for crossing the picket line…: RESULT = NEUTRAL
@the_cam_walker @MahriReilly @ScotRail @Abellio_UK 1/ Democracy affords me the freedoms to make individual choices while respecting the collective decisions of society.

@ScotRail But when will you know if the strikes are going ahead? First they were, then they weren’t, now they are again… at this rate you’ll be confirming next Sunday afternoon which leaves commuters very little time to plan.: RESULT = NEGATIVE
@alextransdev @ScotRail Just imagine if that scene was 1989, and they were all 47s!: RESULT = NEUTRAL
@_rachelsteph Hi Rachel, we’re working on a plan should the strikes go ahead but have no info on which routes would be affected at this time. We’ll share any updates just as soon as we can here: https://t.co/j6QSWFQl5p.^Megan: RESULT = NEGATIVE

@_rachelsteph @theSNP @ScotRail @NicolaSturgeon Never agreed with any of your tweets more than this one pal 😂: RESULT = POSITIVE
Please @theSNP, step in and stop these outrageous @ScotRail strikes during #COP26Glasgow. The Sunday industrial action has caused disruption for months and this planned 2 week strike when the world is watching Scotland will bring the country to a standstill. @NicolaSturgeon: RESULT = NEGATIVE
@OnlyJohn9 @MahriReilly @ScotRail @Abellio_UK Democracy doesn’t cure your scabbing though, does it? 

People disagreeing doesn’t stop them being a scab, they’re just allowed to be. I don’t have to respect that, or them. In fact, I’m 100% entitled to explicitly not respect that position.: RESULT = NEGATIVE
@ScotRail Awwww ok no problem thanks 👍: RESULT = POSITIVE

@ScotRail Thanks. I'll remember to have a £1 coin for it!: RESULT = POSITIVE
@OnlyJohn9 @MahriReilly @ScotRail @Abellio_UK Hate to break it to you, but it just isn’t that important what word you get called. But not supporting striking workers who overwhelmingly voted for said strike, that says more about you I think.: RESULT = NEGATIVE
@ScotRail Ok great thanks!: RESULT = POSITIVE
@RobertClark125 It's from a ticket machine. ^Megan: RESULT = NEUTRAL
@OnlyJohn9 @MahriReilly @ScotRail @Abellio_UK 84% voted for a strike. If you’re a member of the union, and you go to work, you’re a scab. 
Again, the weird obsession with civility and what’s merely “legal” is so strange. Being a scab is legal but like, so what dude??: RESULT = POSITIVE
@ScotRail Thats great. I'm assuming there's a ticket machine there, or do u purchase from the ticket office?: RESULT = POSITIVE
@the_cam_walker @MahriReilly @ScotRail @Abellio_UK Already explained if people can’t be convinced through a good debate, argument for strike action then it’s over.

@ScotRail Evening. How much does it cost to park in the station car park at Cupar all day? It's the nearest car park to the Corn exchange, for the model railway show in December.: RESULT = NEUTRAL
@OnlyJohn9 @MahriReilly @ScotRail @Abellio_UK https://t.co/CGHMDOMmWS? Do you hear yourself you’re like a walking meme. You’ve not presented any positions apart from the strange liberal fetishism of “civility”. Unless there is a strong, strong countervailing reason, strikebreaking or advocating such makes you a scab.: RESULT = POSITIVE

Anyone know when the ScotRail strike begins??: RESULT = NEGATIVE
@OnlyJohn9 @MahriReilly @ScotRail @Abellio_UK I think this really highlights the neoliberal brain fog. Someone annoyed with workers undermining their colleagues who have voted for strike action against exploitation. And one extremely pressed with the term “scab” but, apparently, not the connected exploitation.: RESULT = NEGATIVE
@the_cam_walker @MahriReilly @ScotRail @Abellio_UK Well your obviously pressed enough with people disagreeing with a strike to have to use the word a good few times… go figure!: RESULT = POSITIVE
@AnnoraSims @MarcusLadds @ScotRail @FirstinGlasgow Hi. Yes. For Blantyre depot services known cancellations are posted on the website each day but First Glasgow don't seem to pass details of any cancellations to the Contact Centre sadly.: RESULT = NEGATIVE

All my homies hate Scotrail.: RESULT = NEGATIVE
@OnlyJohn9 @MahriReilly @ScotRail @Abellio_UK Cannot believe how pressed you are at the word scab dude it’s wild.: RESULT = NEUTRAL
@the_cam_walker @MahriReilly @ScotRail @Abellio_UK I don’t demand that you must accept my personal inconvenience as a reason for not striking and I certainly won’t call you something to dehumanise you as to make you the enemy. I understand that individuals will hold different perspectives and opinion.: RESULT = NEGATIVE
@inquisitor111 @MarcusLadds @ScotRail @FirstinGlasgow Will do. Would be nice if the updates they put our were what's actually happening though. Fed up being late for work/missing appointments because the buses that are meant to be running simply aren't: RESULT = POSITIVE
A rail union has said that ScotRail members will continue industrial action into the new year over pay disputes.
https://t.co/IwBFtWu6lq: RESULT = NEGATIVE
@the_cam_walker @MahriReilly @ScotRail @Abellio_UK I have no issue with the right to strike. But just because they strike doesn’t mean I must get in line and agree with it. I don’t agree with how this strike was handled and therefore I don’t support it.: RESULT = POSITIVE
@AnnoraSims @MarcusLadds @ScotRail @FirstinGlasgow You're welcome.  Yes. Unfortunately the driver shortage is unlikely to be resolved anytime soon sadly. It's best to keep checking the updates for any further changes as the conference progresses.: RESULT = POSITIVE
@ScotRail Ok Paul, thanks.: RESULT = POSITIVE
@stevenfenion Hi Steven, due to the number of services impacted by the strike action across the network, we're unable to run replacement buses for every service, I'm afraid. ^Megan: RESULT = NEGATIVE

@ScotRail 8 years I have been travelling from Inverness to Aberdeen on the train. Generally never had much issues but now I've have to buy a 2nd car, something I really didn't want to do but I have no choice. I doubt I will return to the train.  Why no rail replacement on a Sunday?: RESULT = NEGATIVE
@lilpoppersbtch @FORBUCKLEY @ScotRail not the argument to have on ur nsfw acc pal: RESULT = POSITIVE
@lianna_young Hi there, services will be running as scheduled on the 13th. ^Megan: RESULT = NEUTRAL
@the_cam_walker @MahriReilly @ScotRail @Abellio_UK 1/ Because when someone calls a person a scab it invalidates and dehumanise them for simply having a difference of opinion. You win the person over with a good case and if you don’t succeed then that’s the end of the matter: RESULT = POSITIVE
@ScotRail @scotrail are trains on the 13th also cancelled or are they operating again that day?: RESULT = NEGATIVE
@OnlyJohn9 @MahriReilly @ScotRail @Abellio_UK I don’t hold your personal inconvenience to be a good enough reason for workers to have to accept being exploited. Unions have been gutted and broken enough - solidarity is the only way and we’ll learn that the hard way, it seems. Strikebreakers are scabs: RESULT = NEGATIVE
@GetReadyGlasgow as a commuter and non driver that uses public transport to travel to work (into Glasgow). I have been forced to take the entire #COP26Glasgow period off due to @scotgov and @ScotRail inaction. The increasing number of disputes across the city are a reality.: RESULT = NEGATIVE

@MarcusLadds @ScotRail @FirstinGlasgow Hi. Hopefully they will be able to resolve it without any strike.: RESULT = POSITIVE
@OnlyJohn9 @MahriReilly @ScotRail @Abellio_UK Sure, you believe the workers should not be on strike. But they’re the ones with the power and right to vote to take action and so they did. Strikes disrupt and cause problems, as they should and are designed to do.: RESULT = NEGATIVE
@ScotRail @NetworkRailGLC No worries! Thank you Megan :): RESULT = POSITIVE
@OnlyJohn9 @MahriReilly @ScotRail @Abellio_UK 84% of RMT members voted to strike. Is that not democracy? Going against that democratic process and crossing a picket makes you a scab by definition. Of course people can differ. Why does that mean I cannot criticise or say someone is a scab?: RESULT = POSITIVE

@inquisitor111 @ScotRail @FirstinGlasgow That is very good to know. I fully support the strikers, the conditions bus drivers have to endure are awful and they deserve a safe and decent workplace as well as proper compensation for their efforts.  The blame lies with the employers, not strikers. =): RESULT = NEUTRAL
@MarcusLadds @ScotRail @FirstinGlasgow Hi. Any strike action by First drivers if it happens won't affect services during COP26.: RESULT = NEGATIVE

"ScotRail has been in talks for several weeks with trade unions about pay and conditions."

@mleah26 @Getagrippicus @Winston03457509 @RMTunion @ScotRail There are thousands if not hundreds of thousands of issues in society but you know what scotrail is there to get a person from point A to point B so do the job and if you want to be a social justice do gooder then do it on your own time: RESULT = POSITIVE
ScotRail are cunts!: RESULT = NEGATIVE
@mleah26 @Getagrippicus @Winston03457509 @RMTunion @ScotRail 3/ actually I wouldn’t need a union as I would just go to ACAS direct and show them evidence of my contract and being forced to do overtime 🙄: RESULT = NEGATIVE
@mleah26 @Getagrippicus @Winston03457509 @RMTunion @ScotRail 2/ Sorry to say if your contract states you DO NOT have to do any overtime and you’re being forced to do it then you belong to one shitty union who can’t even sort that out: RESULT = NEGATIVE
Fairly unbelievable that this @ScotRail Sunday strike has been going on since the spring. @GraemeDeyMSP needs to sort it out. Remaining trains rammed and buses too leading to increased Covid risk.: RESULT = POSITIVE
@mleah26 @Getagrippicus @Winston03457509 @RMTunion @ScotRail 1/ Nah I’m calling bullshit on the forced overtime. At no time have the union ever stated they were in dispute at members being forced to do overtime.: RESULT = NEGATIVE

@ScotRail Are they running the morra: RESULT = NEUTRAL
@ScotRail Thanks. This is why ScotRail is a total and utter waste of space. If it can't be run reliably the entire network should be shut down and the money invested in decent bus services. Hopefully the COP26 tree huggers will realise why trains don't work in their green Utopia. Shambles.: RESULT = POSITIVE
@bjkisaprick Hi Craig, I'm afraid not. Here's a link showing the only services running today: https://t.co/CMm1qAP6az ^Megan: RESULT = NEUTRAL

@OnlyJohn9 @Getagrippicus @Winston03457509 @RMTunion @ScotRail The railway should all be under 1 union instead of 4 separate unions.

It just happens that RMT cover more departments than the others and there are greater issues.: RESULT = NEUTRAL

@OnlyJohn9 @Getagrippicus @Winston03457509 @RMTunion @ScotRail 1) NO it’s NOT part of my contract. Sundays are overtime NOT park of the working week. Newer contracts have thy you have to do so many a year. My contract does not state it but still I can’t just take it off. So yes it is forced overtime: RESULT = NEGATIVE
@scoty1234 @IeuanDolby @EastScotBias @theSNP So that means it’s been nationalised even before the votes discussing wether it should be nationalised? You unionists are thicker than I thought. The Scottish gov does not run scotrail lmao. Albellio got extra funding cause it didn’t want to run any services: RESULT = NEGATIVE
@Getagrippicus @OnlyJohn9 @Winston03457509 @RMTunion @ScotRail The company are still getting millions from the government every month but not putting it into the company as the government is also paying the full costs of running the railway. So please keep tellinh me they don’t have any money.: RESULT = POSITIVE

@ScotRail It would be helpful if the timetable reflected the lack of service as being due to strike action rather than just no service appearing. Difficult to plan with this kind of service or lack thereof.: RESULT = NEGATIVE

@sophieemuirhead @ScotRail ASLEF and the TSSA have agreed the deal, Unite are recommending it to their members in a vote, the RMT are refusing to even put it to their members and called a strike. So who's fault is the strike, and have you cotacted them rather than @ScotRail: RESULT = NEGATIVE
@ALeitchX Hi Amy, yes, it's scheduled to run.  ^Dean: RESULT = POSITIVE
@AlChivers We can't overbook a service.

@TonyBonner10 @ScotRail It's one of the main reasons and I know they are trying to cut staff and trains, but at this rate, they will all be out of a job if they continue to strike as people will stop using the train and find alternative transport, then they won't need any staff.: RESULT = NEGATIVE

After 6mths of ScotRail conductors’ Sunday strikes, now engineers are striking for COP26. Scots rely on rail services to stay connected in rural &amp; central areas. The irony of encouraging people into cars for COP26 is laughable.

@MattDDobson Yes, as I do all strike action planned during COP26: this timing will hopefully force Councils/Scotrail/Scotgov etc. into conceding better pay &amp; conditions - they've been treating COP as a surface-level PR event &amp; best way to smash that PR with reality.: RESULT = POSITIVE

@ken_caudle @johnqqsmith @gjtorrie @ScotRail And that's why they thought HCQ had efficacy early on.

@ken_caudle @johnqqsmith @gjtorrie @ScotRail How about you start with something simple?

Like watching the full video of the press conference, so you can actually understand what she's saying in context?

Or is that too much of a bother?: RESULT = POSITIVE
@ken_caudle @johnqqsmith @gjtorrie @ScotRail I can literally go to the VAERS website and fill out a report right now.

They require no I.D. verification.

It's also a crime to drive over the speed limit, that doesn't mean everyone who speeds is punished.: RESULT = NEGATIVE
@ken_caudle @johnqqsmith @gjtorrie @ScotRail They don't just count "positive tests".

You have to have died of known COVID related symptoms.

Stop reading nonsense on social media and go review the actual methodology for how COVID deaths are determined.: RESULT = NEGATIVE
@ken_caudle @johnqqsmith @gjtorrie @ScotRail Did you bother researching this at all beyond looking at a 48 second video clip that you don't even apparently understand?: RESULT = NEGATIVE
@ken_caudle @johnqqsmith @gjtorrie @ScotRail Anyone can fill these out.

Doctors are required to report any problem (even death) in close proximity to a vaccination whether they think it is correlated or not.

Again: the raw data is useless.

Each report has to be investigated before a determination is made.: RESULT = NEGATIVE
@ken_caudle @johnqqsmith @gjtorrie @ScotRail May 10th 2020? LOL

Please stop reading this conspiracy nonsense.

Maybe you should take some time to review the actual methodology guidelines for counting COVID deaths, instead of relying on idiotic Tweets from Candace Owens.: RESULT = NEGATIVE
@ScotRail What's underneath you what a load of bull shit crap news: RESULT = NEGATIVE
@ken_caudle @johnqqsmith @gjtorrie @ScotRail VAERS is a self-reporting system.

Anyone can fill out a report.

Reporting is the first step in the process of determining a problem, not the last.

Each report has to be investigated and most turn out to be vaccine un-related.

Raw VAERS data is completely unreliable... https://t.co/Z077FSMRlA: RESULT = NEGATIVE

Half of America has some sort of pre-existing health problem.: RESULT = NEGATIVE
@ken_caudle @johnqqsmith @gjtorrie @ScotRail All COVID deaths are attributed to COVID.

Like with any disease, more comorbidities put you at increased risk of death.

So I'm not even sure what kind of argument you're trying to make.: RESULT = NEGATIVE

@OnlyJohn9 @hannon_matthew @ScotRail Well maybe after this they'll get the pay rise they deserve, without losing t&amp;c's as per the derisory £6.80 a week offer, &amp; those strikes will end. They're affecting me too but I'm not a selfish 'customer', I'm a service user who wants the staff to be paid a fair wage.: RESULT = POSITIVE
@junearchie @ScotRail If strike goes ahead, it will depend on how many Conductors support it. If all support it only the driver only operated services can run as is the case on Sundays now. Also on whether managers can be redeployed to cover some Conductors duties. Best look at alternatives in case.: RESULT = POSITIVE
@cmo0ns @mal1eto £100 for me to get from university to home by scotrail and £10 by bus🤣🤣🤣: RESULT = POSITIVE

As Scotrail announve 12 days of Strikes during one of the biggest events in Scottish History, They tweet this. What about the workers who are having to cancel work or get 2 busses to work now? That's going to cause 'Carbon Emissions' https://t.co/tUBpGFYQAu: RESULT = NEGATIVE
Alt headline: How to Lose a COP in Ten Days https://t.co/an3pJjLxHl: RESULT = NEGATIVE
@richysdagod @ScotRail There is no law stating that a business must accept notes or coins in a transaction: RESULT = POSITIVE
@iainrlennox @BTPScotland @ScotRail @BTP @BTPChief @BTPMurray @BTPWestScot @BTPEastScot @BTPNorthScot @NetworkRailSCOT @transcotland @GlasgowSubway @PoliceScotland Don’t use trains then if you’re not happy about it. Surely you’d rather these checks? Just a shame it takes an incident so serious for this to happen.: RESULT = NEGATIVE
@burnsyburns @pedrosp4 @SeafarerMichael @ScotRail Why would they investigate a non criminal incident?: RESULT = NEGATIVE

@ScotRail See how ScotRail likes the bad publicity when I post this person and their demands and threats to a paying customer on social media 👍: RESULT = NEGATIVE
@ScotRail Can’t deal with staff complaints ok but your staff refusing legal tender and telling people they better have a card next time is breaking the law isn’t it? Many people don’t have bank cards ie elderly, insolvent or bankrupt individuals. Will pull out my phone and record next time: RESULT = NEGATIVE
this is quite comical considering they are striking for 2 weeks during a global climate summit xx https://t.co/9df4OF7s9n: RESULT = NEUTRAL
@strachan1999 @IanAbNe @LNER CrossCountry use 7 coach sets on their Scotland/North East-South West route.
GWR have 4 coach sets used on local services between Cardiff and Penzance.

Network Rail operate 1 or 2 sets as test trains &amp; they go pretty much everywhere.: RESULT = POSITIVE
@smarzeli @gjtorrie @ScotRail people blindly following questionable state orders and willingly pointing out and turning in others to keep on the good side of the state mandating these orders was what led many to toss principle aside and give into fear and turn on their neighbors. ‘Fragile’, lol. Nice try: RESULT = POSITIVE
@ScotRail @gjtorrie Looks like Dean has retained a sense of dignity and fairness in a world gone mad. Be like Dean.: RESULT = POSITIVE
