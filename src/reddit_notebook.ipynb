Scotland, she said, has to manage the transition away from fossil fuels carefully.\\n\\nThis partly recontextualized her decisions for me. Doesn't negate the imperative that transition to renewable is essential, but I understand where she's coming from.\", \"This country is in serious trouble if we don't get away from Westminster\", 'As George Carlin once said nearly 20 years ago:\\n\\nThe planet is fine.

We don‚Äôt sit back in silence and watch other humans struggle. We don‚Äôt hate the English, we believe in justice and humanity and we call out a democratic system that consistently returns a Conservative government in a country where there is only a minority of small minded voters voting Tory.', '**Unionist logic**: If Scots are anything other than hateful angry anti-English bigots, then there may actually be a problem with the UK.

They care about England and their policies show that. But we get dragged in to it anyway, because we're in a union.\\n\\nObviously not everyone feels that way, but a large proportion certainly do.\", \"Like any politician, Sturgeon is viewed positively by her voters and less positively by those who vote for other people. Really it depends on your position on independence, and how right/left wing you are. But broadly speaking I think she's viewed as intelligent, serious and competent as compared with other politicians - the biggest criticism some people have for her is that she directs these qualities towards her political agenda rather than towards governing Scotland in an impartial and inclusive way.\\n\\nAs for English people, about 10% of all Scots have English heritage, and there are some areas where you're more likely to hear an English accent than a Scottish accent. So there's not much animosity, beyond some stuff like bullying in schools and aggro when people get drunk. Generally the poorer the area, the less likely there are to be outsiders there, and so the more likely there will be some negative feeling towards anyone who isn't Scottish - especially if they have a Southern English accent. Northerners might be treated better because they aren't seen as 'posh', which is really what people mean when they say 'English' a lot of the time. I've been accused of being 'English' myself simply for not speaking in a strong accent.\\n\\nAs regards politics, our politicians naturally have a lot of conflict with English politicians for obvious reasons - the majority of Scottish politicians are left-wing and pro-independence, whereas most English MPs are centrist or right-wing, and anti-independence. Add into that a huge amount of ignorance towards Scotland, and you can see why it has led over the years to a situation where a lot of the anti-independence crowd here stay pretty quiet and in some cases actually support Sturgeon, simply because they hate her less than they hate Boris.\", 'I like Ms Sturgeon.', \"half the negative comments here are probably from the same person.

I don\\'t think so, they\\'re no better than the ones who cause shite from the likes of City/United results. The bams oot and aboot carrying knives in Glasgow are the exact same as the ones from London but, there are also normal everyday citizens from England that I\\'m sure we\\'d have a coffee with or a wee throw of a frisbee in the park no bother. The issue I have is with the UK political system and the complete disregard for Scotland and issues in Scotland. The tone you get during PMQs from any Tory MP towards Scotland speaks for itself.

While most violent crime is decreasing over the decades in the UK, it is likely there has historically been significant under reporting of violence against women, particularly low level violence (like all the groping mentioned in this thread - touching someone without consent is a crime).

It found that 51.2 percent reported ‚Äúat least one sexual victimization experience since age 16.‚Äù \\n&gt; About half of the victims reported a female perpetrator.\\n\\n&gt; As well, ‚Äúa 2014 study of 284 men and boys in college and high school found that 43 percent reported being sexually coerced, with the majority of coercive incidents resulting in unwanted sexual intercourse. Of them, 95 percent reported only female perpetrators.\\n\\n&gt; And ‚Äúa 2012 study using data from the U. S. Census Bureau‚Äôs nationally representative National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions found in a sample of 43,000 adults little difference in the sex of self-reported sexual perpetrators.

There\\'ll easily be 2-3 of the most awful stories off the top of their head where they genuinely feared for their life, and then you\\'ll just get this stream of catcalling and groping and threats. Just a constant drone of quite aggressive sexism\\n\\nNo, its not all men, but its way *way* too many men. And frankly I think the rest of us tolerate it way too much, passively, because 80% of people around you seem to be nodding along. Particularly when I was younger, it was very disturbing being in a group of men when the topic of women came up. People viewed them like meat\\n\\nIn the words of a man that I will never speak to again: \"My girlfriend broke up with me, but its no great loss because she had small tits anyway\"\\n\\nI remember being stunned at the time, but he clearly thought it was a fine way to talk to me and that it\\'d just be standard lad banter\\n\\nNow, if you tell me you\\'ve never been in a group of men and heard people start talking about women in a rather.. dehumanising way, then you\\'re not telling the truth. It happens way too often. Particularly the older generation, when they think you\\'re on \\'their\\' side, will express opinions about women that are just absolutely disgusting, like its casual conversation\\n\\nThe real issue is that lots of men think its no harm no foul. They think in terms of \\'scoring\\' with women and get very angry when women stand up to them. Its absolutely disgusting\\n\\nAnd then society at large protects them. At my school, they covered up both a paedophile, and a male teacher physically assaulting one of the female staffers. Nothing was done about the former, and the latter was quietly transferred off somewhere else. This is the story of 1000 abusers\\n\\nIf you feel attacked by this, then maybe you should reflect on your own behaviour. Far, far too many men treat women like objects and a potential receptacle for their penis, instead of human beings\\n\\nI don\\'t feel patronised or attacked by this video. I just feel sad that we live in a society in which we\\'re still trying to fulfil a basic human right of women feeling safe and treated like human beings. They aren\\'t getting treated like that currently, and it is absolutely down to men to change our behaviour. We need to call out shitty behaviour when we see it instead of letting it passively float by, which is something I know I am personally guilty of. I don\\'t personally feel that being a passive observer is really acceptable anymore, because the consequence is pretty dire for women these days', 'Putting aside the content of the video for a moment and looking at the reactions - I think there\\'s a serious (and more political in some ways) question about how an argument should be presented, and why an argument is being presented in the way it is. \\n\\nIf you make a case in such a way that it\\'s seen as a personal attack by enough people, that\\'s probably not great messaging. Call it PR, advertising, campaigning or just communication, that\\'s not a great way to do it if the goal is to push an idea (whether a laudable one or not).\\n\\nSo if we note that the messaging might not all that could be hoped for, we realise we risk being in the realms of \"starting an argument not because you think you can convince anyone, but because you think it\\'ll make you look good to be on the side you\\'re on\".\\n\\nThat\\'s absurdly common amongst politicians.
