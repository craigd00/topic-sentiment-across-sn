However, Scotrail’s proposals involve cutting the off peak service by as much as 50% in addition to the peak services (compared to pre-Covid timetable). This disproportionately affects key workers (think healthcare, hospitality, manufacturing, trades etc.) that don’t work in an office and WFH isn’t and option and who also usually work irregular non 9-5 shifts, so they are more likely to commute in the off peak.\\n\\nWhat ScotRail should’ve done is only cut peak extra services (that mainly serve those who can WFH) and not touch the off peak timetable. As such, there needs to be a pushback against this timetable change.\\n\\nRead about the changes affecting your route and how your service will look like compared to the pre-pandemic timetable. Then voice your opposition in the online consultation form provided! \\n\\nIn addition, write to your MSP and tell them that this is a bad deal for your area. It will discourage even more people from using trains as services will be less frequent, and people will have to wait  up to 50% longer for their train.']\n"
