* Determining Topic Sentiment Across Social Network Platforms
* Craig Dick
* 2378675D
* Supervisor: Peter Inglis

Week-by-week plan for the whole project. Update this as you go along.

## Winter semester

* Project chosen and assigned
* Read literature on topic, set up Github and Overleaf
* Add supervisor to Github and Overleaf, look at python libraries for emotion and sentiment analysis
* Research possible APIs to work with project
* Test available APIs to see what works
* Develop work in Reddit API, create way for Twitter API to search terms
* Keep developing work using Reddit API
* Changed Reddit API to Pushshift API as Reddit API had too many flaws
* VADER was used to analyse some terms to see how it was working
* Scope of project changed to investigate COVID topics, if sentiment analysis can identify some misinformation spreading subreddits
* Ran the Twitter and Reddit API code on COVID search terms, saved to MongoDB
* Investigated top subreddits, found overlap between subreddits. Status report submitted.

## Winter break

* Changed the Reddit code to view percentages instead of number of posts, going to run search terms again to view sentiment over time
## Spring Semester

* Run 2 of the search terms
* Run 3 of the search terms
* Going to use different libraries as well as VADER to analyse sentiment
* Read and collected literature, modularised code, TextBlob comparison
* Afinn sentimnent analysis, research BERT
* Ran code on twitter-roberta-base-sentiment, pretrained BERT model
* Graphics produced, abstract, intro and background of dissertation, dill variables to save sentiment
* Finished background of diss, ran all notebooks again with updated functions to improve code
* Created wordclouds, graphed time, compared Twitter and Reddit, requirements section of diss
* Removed code that wasn't used anymore, wrote out design and implementation
* Evaluation and conclusion, redraft Dissertation submission deadline and presentations.
